# A Dual-branch Convolutional Neural Network with Domain-informed Attention for Arrhythmia Classification of 12-Lead Electrocardiograms
This repository is used with our paper "Two-branch Convolutional Neural Network with Domain-Informed Attention for 12-Lead ECG Arrhythmia Classification". 
This paper uses the CPSC2018 dataset and the PTB-XL dataset.
